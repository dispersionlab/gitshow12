***Patch Parametres***


Module  | Descriptions  | Parameters Info  |  Definitions
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
Nois | WHT <--> *FM*, **VCO-1** | / | White noise has equal intensities at all frequencies. Each voltage is sampled from a normal distribution.
/ | PINK <--> *FM1*, **LFO-1** | / | Pink noise has more bass, and its intensity decreases by -3 dB/octave.     
/ | RED <--> /  |  / | Red noise has even more bass, and its intensity decreases by -6 dB/octave.
Nois | VIOL <--> / | / | Violet noise has even more treble, and its intensity increases by +6 dB/octave.
/ | BLUE <--> / | / | Blue noise has more treble than white noise, and its intensity increases by +3 dB/octave.
/ | GRAY <--> / | / | Gray noise is calibrated to a psychoacoustic equal loudness curve. The human ear does not hear all frequencies with equal intensity (e.g. white noise sounds louder around 1000 Hz than 100 Hz, although its actual power density is the same), so a filter with an equal loudness frequency response is needed to produce noise that sounds uniform across the audible frequency range. In particular, the gray noise generated by VCV Noise is inverse A-weighted.
/ | BLCK <--> / | / | Black noise has no single standard definition, so VCV Noise defines it as “uniform noise”, i.e. voltages sampled from a uniform distribution. Uniform noise has nearly the same frequency response as white noise, except that it contains aliasing. This effect is similar to early digital noise generators or poorly-designed software noise algorithms. However, uniform noise is useful for sample-and-hold sources, CV, and other non-audio purposes.
VCO-1 | / | / | VCO-1 module is a traditional analog/digital oscillator with four output waveforms: SIN (sine), TRI (triangle), SAW (sawtooth), and SQR (square). 
/ | ANLG/DIG <--> **ANLG** | / | ANLG position, analog-modeled waveforms are used. In most cases, like subtractive synthesis, analog waveforms are often preferred due to their imperfect and “more musical” harmonics. ![VOL-1_ANLG_01](https://vcvrack.com/images/Fundamental/VCO-sine.png)![VOL-1_ANLG_02](https://vcvrack.com/images/Fundamental/VCO-tri.png)![VOL-1_ANLG_03](https://vcvrack.com/images/Fundamental/VCO-saw.png)![VOL-1_ANLG_04](https://vcvrack.com/images/Fundamental/VCO-square.png)
/ | **FREQ** knob | 43.257 | The pitch of each oscillator is controlled by the FREQ knob, with a range of 9 octaves. 
/ | HARD/SOFT <--> **SOFT** | 43.257 | SOFT position, soft-sync is used instead, which reverses the direction of the waveform when the sync signal passes through 0V. This results in a “softer” effect with fewer harmonics than hard-sync.
/ | **FINE** knob | -0.123 | FINE knob (only on VCO-1), with an additional range of 2 semitones. 
/ | **P.WIDTH** knob | 75.725 | P. WIDTH knob adjusts the pulse width (aka duty cycle) of the square waveform
/ | **FM CV** knob | 63 | PWM input and its PWM CV attenuator knob allow external pulse width control.               
/ | **PWM.CV** knob | 58.5 | PWM input and its PWM CV attenuator knob allow external pulse width control.
/ | V/OCT | / | FINE
/ | FM <-> *WHT*,**NOIS** | / | FM input applies an additional pitch adjustment with an included FM CV attenuator knob. With the FM CV knob hard-right, the FM input functions similarly to the V/OCT input.
/ | SYNC | / | SYNC input applies hard-syncing to the waveforms by resetting the phase of the waveform when the sync signal passes upward through 0V. If an audio-rate signal is patched into the SYNC input, the result is a waveform having characteristics of both the internal and sync frequencies.           
/ | PWM <-> *SIN*,**VCO-1** | / | PWM input and its PWM CV attenuator knob allow external pulse width control. The following are examples of a digital square wave with 1%, 25%, 50%, and 75% pulse width. ![PWM Pulse Width_01](https://vcvrack.com/images/Fundamental/VCO-01square.png)    ![PWM Pulse Width_02](https://vcvrack.com/images/Fundamental/VCO-25square.png)       ![PWM Pulse Width_03](https://vcvrack.com/images/Fundamental/VCO-50square.png)![PWM Pulse Width_04](https://vcvrack.com/images/Fundamental/VCO-75square.png)
/ | SIN <-> PWM + *Attack*,**ADSR**; + *Sustain*,**ADSR** | *Attack*,**ADSR**:51.531; *Sustain*,**ADSR**: 60.35; | SIN(sine) is one of the four output waveform in VCO-1 (traditional analogy/digital oscillar).
/ | TRI <-> *CV*,**ADSR** | DEC:263.03 | TRI (triangle)is one of the four output waveform in VCO-1 (traditional analogy/digital oscillar).   
/ | SAW <-> *CV*,**DELAY** | FDBK:72.7  | SAW (sawtooth)s one of the four output waveform in VCO-1 (traditional analogy/digital oscillar).                         
/ | SQR <-> *CV*,**DELAY** | TIME:0.26062 | SQR (square)is one of the four output waveform in VCO-1 (traditional analogy/digital oscillar). 
LFO-1 | / | / | LFO-1 can produce four wave types: Sine, Triangle, Saw, and Square. LFO-1 is a low-frequency flavor of VCO-1, with an additional FM Input in place of the VCO's 1/v Oct and a Reset input in place of the VCO-1's Sync input. Patch the LFO's square wave output [SQR] into the gate input of the ADSR.
/ | UNI/BI <-> **BI**  |  /  |  The UNI/BI switch toggles between unipolar (0V to 10V) and bipolar (-5V to 5V) output voltages.

ADSR | / | / | ADSR module manipulates the variables of Attack, Decay, Sustain, and Release easily. 
/ | CV,Attack <-> *SIN*,**VCO-1** | 51.531 | Attack in ADSR is the amount of time it takes from when you first press a key until you hear the full volume of a note's sound.
/ | CV, Decay <-> *TRI*,**VCO-1** | 263.03 | Decay is the amount of TIME it takes for a sound to go from its maximum volume to its minimum volum while still holding a key down.
/ | CV, Sustain <-> *SIN*,**VCO-1** | 60.45 | Sustain is the difference in volume from the beginning of sound to the minimum level of sound while still pressing a key down. It is useful to consider Sustain and Decay at the same time as they are closely connected. 
/ | CV, Release <-> *SIN*,**LFO-1** | 1958.9 | Release is the amount of time it takes for the sound to go to silence after a note has been released. The image here has a very long slow Release.
/ | Gate <-> *TRI*,**LFO-1** | / | GATE output generates 10V
/ | RETRIG <-> / | / | Socket " is the ADSR’s retrigger input, which can be connected, for instance, to the output from an LFO. That means that while the gate is open, the envelope re-triggers every time it senses a pulse from the LFO.
/ | OUT <-> *IN*,**DELAY**; + *IN2*,**SPRING REVERB** | / | /
DELAY | / | / | Delay or 'echo' is a workhorse in any studio. Delay allows us to take a sound and repeat it. We have control over the speed of the repeat as well as the number of times it repeats. Delay can be used to add very nice textures and effects to any performance.
/ | CV, Time <-> *SQR*,**VCO-1** | 0.26062 | Time allows us to adjust the time between repeated sounds. Further to the left can take the sounds down to the milliseconds and to the right provides a delay seconds in duration. Rotating the control to the right can create such fast repeated sounds that it can result in some fascinating textures.
/ | CV, Feedback <-> *SAW*,**VCO-1** | 72.7 | If Time controls the lenght of time between repeated sounds Feedback controls the time it takes for the repeated sounds to fade away to silence. Turning the control all the way to the left will have the sound fade away instantly and all the way to the right will have the sound repeating on and on with now decrease in volume level
/ | CV, Colour <-> / | 70.1 | Colours of noise, each with a different characteristic and frequency response.
/ | CV, Mix <-> / | 90.05 | /
