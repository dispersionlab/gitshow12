At 00:15 and 00:19 there is a high pith tone that interests me. And I am not sure how it was made. I would like to reproduce that sound following the the score rules. 

At 00:35, there is a change in the score, where the left random rate has been used, creating a dense and suspensful atmosphere

Around 01:00 it starts to increase the volume and density of the piece, to then go back to the previous state. From 1:10 to 1:30, it slowly increase the rythimic pattern and the frequency amplitude until its peak at around 1:35, where the sound becomes more aggressive and fast. 
It keeps lik that for about 15 seconds. At 1:50, I can ear a new layer of sound, a higher pitch tone, created by controlling the VCF. Those 2 sounds are playing until 2:10 that the noise and lower frequency sound stops abruptly. Ranom goes back to initial position and the LFO-1 poisiton is in a higher speed that initial. 
 
 Now, I can hear just the tone.
