### Listening to the recording

At 00:15 and 00:19 there is a high pith tone that interests me. And I am not sure how it was made. I would like to reproduce that sound following the the score rules. 

At 00:35, there is a change in the score, where the left random rate has been used, creating a dense and suspensful atmosphere

Around 01:00 it starts to increase the volume and density of the piece, to then go back to the previous state.  
 
From 1:10 to 1:30, it slowly increase the rythimic pattern and the frequency amplitude until it  peaks at around 1:35, where the sound becomes more aggressive and fast. It keeps like that for about 15 seconds. In my opinion, it needs to be taken more to an extreme that chaotic sound. It is as if the performer wnats to take it further but stays safe.  

At 1:50, I can ear a new layer of sound, a higher pitch tone, created by controlling the VCF. Those 2 layers of sound play together until 2:05.  

At 2:05, the noise and lower frequency layer stops abruptly. Random goes back to initial position (0) and the LFO-1 poisiton is in a higher speed that initial.
 
 Now, I can hear just the tone.

### Performing the score	  
  While recreating the recording, I took screenshoots and recorded the samples of each change of sound I was recreating in order to compare them.
