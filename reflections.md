#####Start: 00: 00 ~ 0: 20
The first thing we heard was the rhythmic percussion
Then a major rhythm electronic sound came in.
Some kind of noise, like a drum, but not a sound
There is a very ethereal ringtone behind

#####Main: 0: 20 ~ 1: 05
The sound of a drum-like drum became dull and turned into a sound of hitting metal, and then it became loud again.
The metal percussion turned into some more crisp metal percussion.
After that, the percussion tone continued to increase and the rhythm accelerated.
As the percussion increases, part of the period will turn into a dull and crisp percussion.

#####End: 1: 05 ~ end
Suddenly changed back to the noise of the drums at the beginning, and other sounds faded away, except the ringtone.
The rhythm of the ringtone also slowly slowed down and faded out.
